# Self Driving Car Game

## Description

Created for CSUF Artificial Intelligence Class (CPSC 481).

Self-driving car game that uses Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) to navigate around user-made tracks.

Created with PyGame to create the user interface and game logic.\
Uses NEAT-Python library to create the logic behind NEAT including initialization, reproduction, and evolution of individuals.

## Usage

#### Dependencies: 
<ul>
<li>PyGame v2.0.0 dev5</li>
<li>NEAT-Python v0.92</li>
<li>pickleshare v0.7.5</li>
</ul>

#### To run:
<ol>
<li>Install Python3 if not already installed</li>
<li>Open terminal/command prompt</li>
<li>Enter command "python3 main.py"</li>
</ol>

Game should now run with pre-made track and a initial population of 30 cars.


## To be done:
Creating tracks is currently implemented, but parts of the code must be enabled/disabled. Implementation of switching between AI / User version is next.
